### What I learned

I learned how to complete the challenge by making the QR code components as similar as possible to the design of the challenge, and this was great to increase my experience as a beginner

```html
<h1>Hi I'am tucill.</h1>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

```js
const sayHi = () => {
  console.log("Hi I'am tucill");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to become a frontend developer who is experienced in building beautiful, responsive and interactive websites.
